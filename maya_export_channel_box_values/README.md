# Python script for Maya

## project "Maya and SIMM modelling"
This project is part of the Chapter 8 of my PhD thesis. Link to the thesis will be updated once it becomes publicly available.

## Description
This script export the channel box values for selected objects in the Maya scene. 
At this version, it requires you to have a csv file created before running the code.
I will modify the code so that future users do not need to create a csv file.

dummy landmakrs with the same names are removed on line 34 according to Maya's naming convention. 

I used this script to export landmarks for the locations of muscle insertions on skeletal bones.
Modify the outpath on line 14 and write mode on line 35 as needed.
