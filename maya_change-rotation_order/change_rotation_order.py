"""
Maya join rotation order determines the orders in which Maya rotates X, Y, and Z axes of an object. 
This can be changed individually in the Attribute editor under Transform attributes. 
Note that rotation order is opposite to the left to righe order on the label.
For example, xyz indicates rotations starts from z to y to x.
