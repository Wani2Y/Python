# Python script for Maya

## project "Maya and SIMM modelling"
This project is part of the Chapter 7 of my PhD thesis. Link to the thesis will be updated once it becomes publicly available.

## Description
This script changes the rotation orders of all objects in the Maya scene simultaneously, without the need to modify the rotation order in the Attribute editor for each object.
Copy the entire script, and run it in the script editor in Maya. 
Modify the index of rotation order on the last code line as needed.
